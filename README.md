# My Chess Engine
This is a Bitboard based chess engine. It's coded from scratch solely by me, using C++. It works pretty well. It can comfortable beat me (which isn't neccessarily saying much). It also comes with a python program which runs tournaments between different versions in order to see if they are improving. It has the UCI interface which allows it to communicate with other chess engines/ programmes.
